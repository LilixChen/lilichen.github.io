Hi, I'm Lili, an [Associate Lecturer](https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/910137-lili-chen) (Education Specialist) in the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering. I completed my PhD in Wireless Communication supervised by [Prof. Jamie Evans](https://about.unimelb.edu.au/leadership/senior-leadership/provost/professor-jamie-evans) and [Dr. Jingge Zhu](https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/833183-jingge-zhu) at the University of Melbourne in 2025. My doctoral research focused on the application of Graph Neural Networks for resource management in wireless communications. During my PhD, I was awarded first place in the 5-Minute Thesis Competition at the 21st Australian Communication Theory Workshop (AusCTW) and received the Best Student Poster Presentation award at the 22nd AusCTW. I'm also a recipient of the prestigious [Diane Lemaire Scholarship](https://eng.unimelb.edu.au/students/scholarships-prizes-and-awards/graduate-research-students/scholarships/scholarships/diane-lemaire). I hold both a Master's and a Bachelor's degree in Electrical and Electronic Engineering, graduating with top honors and being named on the [Dean's Honours List](https://eng.unimelb.edu.au/students/scholarships-prizes-and-awards/sap/deans-honours-award).

Alongside my research, I have extensive teaching experience in delivering engaging tutorials and workshops across a range of undergraduate and postgraduate subjects, including Foundations of Electrical Networks, Signals and Systems, Analog and Digital Electronics Concepts, Probability and Random Models, and Communication Systems. My commitment to integrating innovative research with effective teaching continues to drive my contributions to the academic community.
