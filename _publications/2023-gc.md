Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently emerged
as a promising approach to tackling power allocation problems in
wireless networks. Since unpaired transmitters and receivers are
often spatially distant, the distance-based threshold is proposed to
reduce the computation time by excluding or including the channel
state information in GNNs. In this paper, we are the first to introduce a neighbour-based threshold approach to GNNs to reduce the
time complexity. Furthermore, we conduct a comprehensive analysis
of both distance-based and neighbour-based thresholds and provide
recommendations for selecting the appropriate value in different
communication channel scenarios. We design the corresponding
neighbour-based Graph Neural Networks (N-GNN) with the aim
of allocating transmit powers to maximise the network throughput.
Our results show that our proposed N-GNN offer significant advantages in terms of reducing time complexity while preserving strong
performance and generalisation capacity. Besides, we show that by
choosing a suitable threshold, the time complexity is reduced from
$O(|V|^2)$ to $O(|V|)$, where $|V|$ is the total number of transceiver pairs
