Due to mutual interference between users, power
allocation problems in wireless networks are often non-convex
and computationally challenging. Graph neural networks (GNNs)
have recently emerged as a promising approach to tackling
these problems and an approach that exploits the underlying
topology of wireless networks. In this paper, we propose a novel
graph representation method for wireless networks that include
full-duplex (FD) nodes. We then design a corresponding FD
Graph Neural Network (F-GNN) with the aim of allocating
transmit powers to maximise the network throughput. Our
results show that our F-GNN achieves state-of-art performance
with significantly less computation time. Besides, F-GNN offers
an excellent trade-off between performance and complexity
compared to classical approaches. We further refine this tradeoff by introducing a distance-based threshold for inclusion or
exclusion of edges in the network. We show that an appropriately
chosen threshold reduces required training time by roughly $20\%$
with a relatively minor loss in performance
