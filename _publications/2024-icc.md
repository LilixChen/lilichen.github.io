The optimal allocation of channels and power resources plays a crucial role in ensuring minimal interference, maximal data rates, and efficient energy utilisation. As a successful
approach for tackling resource management problems in wireless
networks, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have attracted a lot of
attention. This article proposes a GNN-based algorithm to address
the joint resource allocation problem in heterogeneous wireless
networks. Concretely, we model the heterogeneous wireless network as a heterogeneous graph and then propose a graph neural
network structure intending to allocate the available channels and
transmit power to maximise the network throughput. Our proposed joint channel and power allocation graph neural network
(JCPGNN) comprises a shared message computation layer and
two task-specific layers, with a dedicated focus on channel and
power allocation tasks, respectively. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves satisfactory
performance but with higher computational efficiency compared
to traditional optimisation algorithms.
