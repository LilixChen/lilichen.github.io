Work with Prof. Gavin Buskes and Dr. Shiva Balendhran

Topics include:

Analog systems - time-domain differential equation models of RLC networks, initial conditions, transient response, transfer functions, frequency response, passive filters, impedance functions, two-port networks and dependent sources and matrix circuit representations, op-amp models.

Digital systems – encoding information and digital data processing, CMOS realisation of basic logic gates, timing contracts, acyclic networks, switching algebra, combinational logic synthesis, cyclic networks and memory, finite-state machines, metastability, synchronous timing and synchronisation, data-processing paths, control logic and stored-program machines.

Aspects of these topics will be explored through laboratory work involving simulation tools and hardware experiments.
