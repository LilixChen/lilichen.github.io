Work with Prof. Jamie Evans

Topics include:

Introduction to communication systems including historical developments and comparisons between analogue and digital communications.

Review of assumed knowledge from linear algebra, signals and systems and probability and random processes.

The sampling theorem, analog-to-digital conversion, complex baseband representation of passband signals, filtering of random processes, power spectral density, bandwidth of random signals, additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN), signal-to-noise ratio.

Communication over baseband AWGN channels including modulation techniques (pulse amplitude modulation, orthogonal modulation), signal space representation, optimal detectors, matched filters, error probability calculations and bandwidth / power trade-off.

Communication over passband AWGN channels including modulation techniques (phase shift keying, quadrature amplitude modulation and frequency shift keying), optimal coherent detectors, noncoherent detectors and error probability calculations.

Communication over linear time-invariant channels including concepts of distortion, inter-symbol interference, pulse shaping, Nyquist’s criterion, equalization, sequence detection and the Viterbi algorithm.
Synchronization including carrier, symbol and frame synchronization.
