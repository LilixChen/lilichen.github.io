Work with Prof. Gavin Buskes, Prof. Brian Krongold and Dr. Robert Schmid

The subject will cover key electrical engineering topics in the areas of:

Electrical phenomena – charge, current, electrical potential, conservation of energy and charge, the generation, storage, transport and dissipation of electrical power.

Network models – networks of “flow-drop” one-port elements, Kirchoff’s laws, standard current-voltage models for one-ports (independent sources, resistors, capacitors, inductors, transducers, diodes), analysis of static networks, properties of linear time-invariant (LTI) one-ports and impedance functions, diodes, transformers, steady-state (DC and AC) analysis of LTI networks via mesh and node techniques, equivalent circuits, and transient analysis of simple circuits;

Electrical power systems – overview of power generation and transmission, analysis of single-phase and balanced three-phase AC power systems.

Analysis and design of networks involving ideal and non-ideal operational amplifiers.
