Work with Prof. Brian Krongold

Topics include:

Foundations – combinatorial analysis, axioms of probability, independence, conditional probability, Bayes’ rule;

Random variables (rv’s)– definition; cumulative distribution, probability mass and probability density functions; expectation and variance; functions of an rv; important distributions and their properties and uses;

Multiple random variables – joint cumulative distribution, probability mass and probability density functions; independent rv’s; correlation and covariance; conditional distributions and expectation; functions of several rv’s; jointly Gaussian rv’s; random vectors;

Sums, inequalities and limit theorems – sums of rv’s, moment generating function; Markov and Chebychev inequalities; weak and strong laws of large numbers; the Central Limit Theorem;

Decision testing - maximum likelihood, maximum a posterior, minimum cost and Neyman-Pearson rules; basic minimum mean-square error estimation;

Stochastic processes – mean and autocorrelation functions, strict and wide-sense stationarity; ergodicity; important processes and their properties and uses;

Introduction to Markov chains.
